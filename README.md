This project focuses on **automating processes, managing data efficiently, and improving customer relationships** – all within the Salesforce ecosystem.

## ✨ What This Project Is About

I wanted to create a **real-world Salesforce use case** where:

✅ Customers **automatically get order confirmation emails** 📧
✅ Loyalty programs are **dynamic and personalized** 🎁
✅ Warehouse teams **never miss stock alerts** when products go below 5 units 📦
✅ Bulk orders **get processed every night automatically** 🌙
